******* NOTES **********

IMPORTANT!

The ensemble file must be put in the folder INPUT_FILES/ENSEMBLE. The last 2 characters of the ensemble filename should indicate the ensemble sample number (i.e. '_01.txt' for ensemble 1, '_02.txt' for ensemble 2...).


MORE ON INPUT PARAMETERS

* TectonicRegionType: as defined in OpenQuake tectonic regionalisation.
* Magnitude_Scaling_Relationship: as required from openquake.hazardlib.scalerel.
* ID_Event: Shakemap ID of the event.
* POIsfile: two space-separated columns .txt file with LAT and LON of the POIs.
* Vs30file: GMT .grd Vs30 file; if not provided, default Vs30 value (760 m/s) is used.
* CorrelationModel: as required from openquake.hazardlib.correlation.
* CrosscorrModel: as required from openquake.hazardlib.cross_orrelation.
* vs30_clustering: `True` value means that Vs30 values are expected to show clustering (as required from openquake.hazardlib.correlation).
* truncation_level: number of standard deviations for truncation of the cross-correlation model distribution (as required from openquake.hazardlib.cross_correlation).
* NumGMPEsRealizations: total number of GMPEs realizations at a specific POI for spatial and crosscorrelation of ground motion fields.
* num_processes: number of processes for code parallelization.
