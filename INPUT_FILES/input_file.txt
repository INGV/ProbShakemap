******* NOTES **********


* TectonicRegionType: as defined in OpenQuake tectonic regionalisation.
* Magnitude_Scaling_Relationship: as required from openquake.hazardlib.scalerel.
* Rupture_aratio: rupture aspect ratio as required from openquake.hazardlib.geo.surface.PlanarSurface.from_hypocenter
* ID_Event: Shakemap ID of the event.
* Vs30file: GMT .grd Vs30 file; if not provided, set it to None. Default Vs30 value (760 m/s) will be used instead.
* CorrelationModel: as required from openquake.hazardlib.correlation.
* CrosscorrModel: as required from openquake.hazardlib.cross_orrelation.
* vs30_clustering: `True` value means that Vs30 values are expected to show clustering (as required from openquake.hazardlib.correlation).
* truncation_level: number of standard deviations for truncation of the cross-correlation model distribution (as required from openquake.hazardlib.cross_correlation).
